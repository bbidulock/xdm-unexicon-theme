Release
-------

This is the @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@ package, released @DATE@.  This release,
and the latest version, can be obtained from the GitHub repository at
(http://github.com/bbidulock/@PACKAGE@), using a command such as:

    $> git clone http://github.com/bbidulock/@PACKAGE@.git

Please see the `NEWS' file for release notes and history of user visible
changes for the current version, and the `ChangeLog' file for a more
detailed history of implementation changes.  The `TODO' file lists
features not yet implemented and other outstanding items.

Please see the `INSTALL' file for installation instructions.

When working from `git(1)', following the instructions in this file.  An
abbreviated installation procedure that works for most applications
appears below.

Quick Start:
------------

The quickest and easiest way to get @PACKAGE@ up and running is to run
the following commands:

    $> git clone https://github.com/bbidulock/@PACKAGE@.git @PACKAGE@
    $> cd @PACKAGE@
    $> ./autogen.sh
    $> ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
    $> make V=0
    $> make DESTDIR="$pkgdir" install

This will configure, compile and install @PACKAGE@ the quickest.  For
those who like to spend the extra 15 seconds reading ./configure --help,
some compile time options can be turned on and off before the build.
@PACKAGE@, however, does not provide any compile time options of its
own.

For general information on GNU's ./configure, see the file `INSTALL'.
